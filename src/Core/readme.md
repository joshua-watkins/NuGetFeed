# NuGetFeed.Core

The NuGet V3 protocol: models and a client, as specified by the [NuGet API overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/overview).
It has no knowledge of how packages are stored. The important folders are:

* Models - The protocol's request and response models, including NuGetFeed's extensions
* ServiceIndex, PackageContent, PackageMetadata, Search, Catalog - Clients for each protocol resource
* PackageDetails - Client for the information a gallery shows on a package's page
* `NuGetClient` / `NuGetClientFactory` - Entry points to talk to any NuGet V3 feed
