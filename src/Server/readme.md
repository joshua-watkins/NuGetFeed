# NuGetFeed.Server

The backend that implements the [NuGet service APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/api/overview)
and persists packages. It's a library: the Windows and Linux hosts in `pub` run it, with the website,
by calling `services.AddNuGetFeed(...)`, `app.UseNuGetFeed()` and `endpoints.MapNuGetFeed()`. To run it
during development, start the Windows host (`pub/Windows`). Hosts can also support the server's command
line commands, like `import downloads`, with `NuGetFeedCommands`.
The important folders are:

* Endpoints - The NuGet V3 API endpoints, as minimal APIs
* Indexing - Logic to upload and delete packages and symbols, and to deprecate packages
* Metadata, Content, Search, ServiceIndex - Server implementations of the protocol resources
* Catalog - The append-only record of package changes, served as the catalog resource
* Vulnerabilities - Known vulnerabilities, served to NuGet Audit
* Signing - Repository signing of pushed packages
* Entities - The package database (SQLite by default)
* Storage - Stores the content of packages and symbols on the file system
* Upstream - Interactions with an upstream NuGet feed when mirroring

## Resources

Besides package push, delete, content, metadata, search and autocomplete, the service index advertises:

| Resource | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `RegistrationsBaseUrl/3.6.0` | Includes SemVer 2.0.0 packages. The older registration resources leave them out. |
| `SearchQueryService/3.5.0` | Search supports the `packageType` filter. |
| `Catalog/3.0.0` | Records every push, unlist, relist, deprecation, vulnerability change and deletion. |
| `ReadmeUriTemplate/6.13.0` | Package readmes. |
| `VulnerabilityInfo/6.7.0` | Only advertised once a vulnerability is recorded. |
| `PackageDetailsUriTemplate/5.1.0` | Set `PackageDetailsUriTemplate` in appsettings.json. HTTPS only. |
| `RepositorySignatures/4.7.0`, `4.9.0`, `5.0.0` | Set `RepositorySigning` in appsettings.json. HTTPS only. |

## NuGet V2

The NuGet V2 (OData) feed is not supported, and there are no plans to support it. Clients that only
speak V2, like Chocolatey and PowerShellGet v2, can't use this server. `GET` requests under `api/v2/`
return a 404 that points to the V3 service index. Push, delete and relist still use `api/v2/package`,
because that's the path the V3 `PackagePublish/2.0.0` resource uses.

## Administration

These endpoints aren't part of the NuGet protocol. Like push and delete, they need the
`X-NuGet-ApiKey` header when `ApiKey` is set, and are disabled in read-only mode.

Deprecate a package version (reasons: `Legacy`, `CriticalBugs`, `Other`), or undeprecate it:

```sh
curl -X PUT https://nuget.example.com/api/package/Contoso.Utils/1.0.0/deprecation \
  -H "X-NuGet-ApiKey: $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reasons":["Legacy"],"message":"Use Contoso.Tools instead.","alternatePackageId":"Contoso.Tools"}'

curl -X DELETE https://nuget.example.com/api/package/Contoso.Utils/1.0.0/deprecation -H "X-NuGet-ApiKey: $KEY"
```

Record a known vulnerability (severity: 0 low, 1 moderate, 2 high, 3 critical), or remove it.
Recording an advisory again with the same package ID and URL updates it.

```sh
curl -X PUT https://nuget.example.com/api/vulnerabilities \
  -H "X-NuGet-ApiKey: $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"packageId":"Contoso.Utils","versions":"(, 1.2.0)","url":"https://example.com/advisories/1","severity":2}'

curl -X DELETE "https://nuget.example.com/api/vulnerabilities?packageId=Contoso.Utils&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fadvisories%2F1" \
  -H "X-NuGet-ApiKey: $KEY"
```

## Repository signing

With a code signing certificate configured, packages pushed over HTTPS get this server's repository
signature, and the repository signatures resource lists the certificate. Packages that already have a
repository signature, like packages from nuget.org, keep it. `allRepositorySigned` is only true once
every package carries this server's signature.

```json
"RepositorySigning": {
  "CertificatePath": "signing.pfx",
  "CertificatePassword": "",
  "TimestampServerUrl": "http://timestamp.digicert.com"
}
```

Use `CertificateThumbprint` (with `CertificateStoreLocation` and `CertificateStoreName`) instead of
`CertificatePath` to load the certificate from a certificate store.
